\section{Introduction}
\subsection{About this project}\label{subsec:about}
The goal of this student research project was to gain some familiarity with the \CP problem in particular and combinatorial optimization techniques in general.
Knowledge about classes of facet-defining inequalities is of vital interest for solving combinatorial optimization problems through branch-and-cut algorithms.
Therefore, the task of the project was to review the available literature on such classes and implement separation routines for as many of them as possible.
The relatively new class of \textit{half-chorded odd cycle inequalities} first described by \cite{andresPolyhedralStudyLifted2022} was of particular interest, because their practical use was unknown so far.
The separation routines should then be tested on data available from the literature as well as new instances.

The remainder of this section will give a brief overview of the \CP problem, but for an in-depth introduction we refer the reader to \cite{grotschelFacetsCliquePartitioning1990}.
The structure of the rest of the document is as follows:

\subsection{The \CP problem}\label{subsec:cp_problem}
The \CP problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that was first investigated by \cite{grotschelFacetsCliquePartitioning1990} as a framework for aggregation of binary relations.
The objective is to cluster a given set of objects with respect to their pairwise similarities into ‘maximally homogenous’ sets.

\begin{definition}[\CP]\label{def:cp}
	Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset of edges $A \subseteq E$ is called a \textit{clique partitioning of $G$} if there exists a partition $\Gamma = \left\{ W_1, W_2, \ldots, W_k \right\}$ of $V$ such that
	\[
		A = \bigcup_{i=1}^k \left\{ (u,v) \in E \mid u,v \in W_i \right\}.
	\]
\end{definition}
\begin{note}
A clique partitioning $A$ consists precisely of the edges that connect vertices within the same block $W_i$ of the partition $\Gamma$.
Thus, every clique partitioning $A$ induces an equivalence relation $\sim_A$ on $V$, and every equivalence relation on $V$ corresponds uniquely to a clique partitioning of $G$.
\cref{fig:example_clique_partitioning} shows an example of a clique partitioning.
\end{note}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\begin{tikzpicture}
        \def \n{8};
        \def \radius{1.5cm};
        \def \r{0.3cm};
        \foreach \i in {0,...,\n}{
			\node[vertex] (\i) at ({\i/(\n+1)*360+90}:\radius) {};
			\node at ({\i/(\n+1)*360+90}:\radius+\r) {$v_{\i}$};
        }
        \foreach \i in {0,...,\n}{
            \foreach \j in {\i,...,\n}{
                \draw[dashed, gray] (\i) -- (\j);
        	}
        }
        \foreach \i/\j in {1/8, 1/3, 1/5, 8/3, 8/5, 3/5} {
			\draw[line width=0.3mm] (\i) -- (\j);
        }
        \foreach \i/\j in {4/6, 4/7, 6/7} {
			\draw[line width=0.3mm] (\i) -- (\j);
        }
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption[Example clique partitioning]{An example of a clique partitioning $A$ for $K_{9}$. 
		Solid lines represent edges that are part of the clique partitioning and dashed lines represent edges $e \in E_{9} \setminus A$.
	The induced partition is $\Gamma = \left\{ \left\{ v_{0} \right\}, \left\{ v_{2} \right\}, \left\{ v_{1}, v_{3}, v_{5}, v_{8} \right\}, \left\{ v_{4}, v_{6}, v_{7} \right\} \right\}$.}
	\label{fig:example_clique_partitioning}
\end{figure}

Typically, one only considers complete graphs $K_n$, as this poses the least restrictions on the set of feasible solutions.
Consider \eg the example given in \cref{fig:incomplete_graph}.
The nodes $i$ and $k$ cannot end up in the same block of the partition except $j$ is also in this block.
In many applications of \CP (\eg the instances given in \cite{grotschelCuttingPlaneAlgorithm1989}), every clique partitioning should be a feasible solution.
We will therefore restrict our attention to the case of complete graphs for the rest of the paper.
With this assumption every block $W_i$ induces a clique, \ie a complete subgraph of $G$, hence the name \textit{clique} partitioning.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node[vertex, label=below:{$i$}] (i) at (0,0) {};
		\node[vertex, label=below:{$j$}] (j) at (1,0) {};
		\node[vertex, label=below:{$k$}] (k) at (2,0) {};

		\draw (i) -- (j);
		\draw (j) -- (k);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{An incomplete graph.}
	\label{fig:incomplete_graph}
\end{figure}

The \CP problem is then the following.
Given a complete graph $K_n=(V_n,E_n)$ and edge weights $w \in \R^{E_n}$, find a clique partitioning of minimal weight.
The problem is known to be \textsc{NP}-hard in the strong sense \cite{wakabayashiAggregationBinaryRelations1986}.
We will just briefly mention the trivial cases.
If all entries in $w$ are non-negative, the empty clique partitioning is one optimal solution.
Likewise, if all entries are non-positive, the maximal clique partitioning $A = E$ is an optimal solution.
Furthermore, if the non-positive edges in $w$ induce cliques, then the optimal partition will consists exactly of these clique.
More ‘interesting’ instances must therefore contain ‘conflicts’, \ie they must contain vertices with both positive and negative edges.

\subsection{An ILP-formulation of \CP}\label{subsec:ilp_formulation}
Any valid clique partitioning of a (complete) graph $K_{n}=(V_{n}, E_{n})$ can be characterized by a vector $x \in \left\{ 0,1 \right\}^{E_{n}}$.
Furthermore, \cite{grotschelFacetsCliquePartitioning1990} showed that a vector $x \in \left\{ 0,1 \right\}^{E_{n}}$ characterizes a clique partitioning iff it satisfies the \textit{triangle inequalities}:
\[
	 x_{ij} + x_{jk} - x_{ik} \leq 1
\]
for all pairwise distinct $i,j,k \in V_{n}$.
Thus, we arrive at the following ILP formulation of the \CP problem:

\begin{align*}
	\min && &\sum_{e \in E_{n}} w_{e} x_{e} \\[1.5ex]
	\text{subject to } && &x_{e} \in \left\{ 0,1 \right\} && \forall e \in E_{n} \\
					   && &x_{uv} + x_{uw} - x_{uw} \leq 1 && \forall \left\{ u,v,w \right\} \in \binom{V_{n}}{3} \\
\end{align*}
