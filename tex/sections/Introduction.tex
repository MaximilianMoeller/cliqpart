\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project was to gain some familiarity with the \CP problem in particular and combinatorial optimization techniques in general.
Especially knowledge about classes of facet-defining inequalities is of vital interest for solving combinatorial optimization problems through branch-and-cut algorithms.
Therefore, the task of the project was to review the available literature on such classes and implement separation routines for as many of them as possible.
The relatively new class of $2$-chorded-half-cycle inequalities first described by \cite{andresPolyhedralStudyLifted2022} was of particular interest, because their use in practical applications was unknown so far.
The separation routines should then be tested on data available from the literature as well as new instances.
