For two-chorded odd cycle inequalities:
When the Belman-Ford algorithm for a pair $u_{1}^{i,j}\hat{u}_{1}^{i,j}$ has returned no violated path we know that this edge is not part of any violated cycle.
We could therefore delete this gadget from the auxiliary graph and continue the search for other violated inequalities.
