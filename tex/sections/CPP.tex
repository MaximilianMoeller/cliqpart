\subsection{Two-chorded odd cycle inequalities}
This class was found by \cite{grotschelFacetsCliquePartitioning1990} but a polynomial time separation routine was first described by \cite{mullerPartialOrderPolytope1996}.

\todo{use flooring or 1/2(k-1) variant of equation?}
\begin{definition}[$2$-chorded odd cycle inequalities]\label{def:2-chords}
	Let $5 \leq k \leq n$ with $k$ odd, and let $v\colon \Z_k \to \Z_n$ injective.
	The $2$-chored odd cycle inequality with respect to $v$ is defined as:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:2-chords}
		\sum_{i \in \Z_k} \left( x_{v_i v_{i+1}} - x_{v_i v_{i+2}} \right) \leq \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} k \right\rfloor
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\todo{distinguish definition of 2-chorded inequalities and theorem that they are valid (and for k odd even f.d.)}
