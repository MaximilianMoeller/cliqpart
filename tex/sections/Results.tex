\subsection{A Note on Computation Time}
Admittedly, exact running time was of less concern to us than the qualitative differences in LP relaxations obtained from the use of different run configurations.
The measurement techniques we used gave us a good grasp on the overall progress made per iteration.
However, we do not believe that they were sophisticated enough to report accurately on the time frames of interest here.
Especially in (but not limited to) the first few iterations, many violated constraints can be found quickly, leading to durations in the order of milliseconds for a whole iteration, \ie solving the LP and separating the obtained solution.
While we do feel comfortable reporting on durations in the order of seconds and upwards, which can often be found for the \texttt{half} and \texttt{two} separators as well as for the overall computation time of a run, we advice the reader to treat smaller durations with caution.
