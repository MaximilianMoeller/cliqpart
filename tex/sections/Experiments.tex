\section{Computational Experiments}\label{sec:comp}
In this section we describe the experiments performed and present the results obtained from them.
First we explain the setup and configurations for the separators mentioned in \cref{sec:sep}.
Then we present the computational results along with some indications to their expressiveness.

\subsection{Setup}\label{subsec:comp_setup}
All tests were performed on the same machine running Ubuntu 23.04 as the operating system.
The machine contains an Intel Core i9-12900KF processor running at ??\todo{Frequenz rausfinden (BIOS)} GHz and 64GB of DDR5 RAM. 

The separation routines were implemented in \texttt{C++}.
While some aspects of the code could be improved (\eg computations of shortest paths in parallel like in \cite{sorensenSeparationHeuristic2Partition2020}),
performance was a big concern and we tried to implement the routines as efficiently as possible in the amount of time available for the project.

\href{https://www.gurobi.com}{Gurobi} was used for both, computing the exact solution to the ILP problem and as the LP solver for the cutting plane algorithm.
We chose Gurobi because of its performance compared to other solvers (see \cite{meindlAnalysisCommercialFree2012}) and the capability of solving ILPs and LPs within the same framework.
The code infrastructure is designed flexible enough to use the separation routines either as callbacks to Gurobis ILP solver, or by passing a LP solution directly to them.
Therefore, replacing the LP solver would be fairly easy, \eg for comparing performances of different solvers for this specific problem.
However, this is beyond the scope of the project.
