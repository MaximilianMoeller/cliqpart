\section{Separators}\label{sec:sep}
This section is concerned with the separation routines (called \textit{separators} for short) for the classes of inequalities described in \cref{sec:cpp}.

\subsection{Two-chorded odd cycle inequalities}
The class of two-chorded odd cycle inequalities was shown to be seperable in polynomial time by \cite{mullerPartialOrderPolytope1996}.
Their paper is mainly concerned with the partial order polytope of a \textit{directed} graph.
However, the algorithm described there for separating \textit{odd closed walk} inequalities can be adapted to to separate a class of valid inequalities for the \CP polytope, that contains the class of two-chorded odd cycle inequalities.

We are however only interested in the class of two-chorded inequalities (and not this broader class) and will therefore repeat the argument given, but slightly adapted for this narrower class.

Since 2-chorded cycle inequalities are only facet defining for cycles of odd length, we can also rewrite \ref{eq:2-chords} as

\begin{equation*}
	\sum_{i \in \Z_k} \left( x_{v_i v_{i+1}} - x_{v_i v_{i+2}} \right) \leq \frac{1}{2} (k-1)
\end{equation*}

By subtracting $\frac{1}{2}k$ from both sides and after rearranging we obtain:

\begin{equation*}
	\sum_{i \in \Z_k} x_{v_i v_{i+1}} - \sum_{i \in \Z_k} \left(x_{v_i v_{i+2}} + \frac{1}{2} \right) \leq -\frac{1}{2}
\end{equation*}

\todo{where do i want to go with this? Somehow the edge weights of the auxiliary graph should fall out of this.}
