  abstract = {A subsetA of the edge set of a graphG = (V, E) is called a clique partitioning ofG is there is a partition of the node setV into disjoint setsW1,⋯,Wk such that eachWi induces a clique, i.e., a complete (but not necessarily maximal) subgraph ofG, and such thatA = ∪i=1k1\{uv|u, v ∈ Wi,u ≠ v\}. Given weightswe∈ℝ for alle ∈ E, the clique partitioning problem is to find a clique partitioningA ofG such that ∑e∈Awe is as small as possible. This problem—known to be-hard, see Wakabayashi (1986)—comes up, for instance, in data analysis, and here, the underlying graphG is typically a complete graph. In this paper we study the clique partitioning polytope of the complete graphKn, i.e., is the convex hull of the incidence vectors of the clique partitionings ofKn. We show that triangles, 2-chorded odd cycles, 2-chorded even wheels and other subgraphs ofKn induce facets of. The theoretical results described here have been used to design an (empirically) efficient cutting plane algorithm with which large (real-world) instances of the clique partitioning problem could be solved. These computational results can be found in Grötschel and Wakabayashi (1989).},

Integer-Linear Programming (ILP) turned out to be a powerful tool to solve these problems, as beyond traditional constraints, Boolean variables may be used to model complex logical expressions and conditionals. One of the key technical aspects is to be able to efficiently express these relations within the ILP. This paper presents formalized solutions for these issues, as well as an assessment of common ILP solvers. Additionally, the performance impact is illustrated using a compiler based cache aging optimization.},

Moreover, the performance of different solvers is evaluated on the basis of solving multiple attacker problems in a case study. These problem class is important when dealing with the CSP.}

Other important aspects of successful implementations are discussed in this chapter. The area of branch-and-cut algorithms is constantly evolving, and it promises to become even more important with the exploitation of faster computers and parallel computing.},

The results imply a polynomial separation algorithm for a class of valid inequalities of the clique partitioning polytope that includes the two-chorded odd cycle inequalities.The polyhedral results concerning the partial order polytope are of interest since a cutting plane based algorithm to solve the maximum weighted transitive acyclic subdigraph problem can be used to solve the maximum weighted acyclic subdigraph problem, the maximum weighted linear ordering problem and a flexible manufacturing problem.For the acyclic subdigraph polytope we show that the separation of simplet-reinforcedk-fence-inequalities is-complete.},

A subset A ⊆ E is called a clique partition if there is a partition of V into nonempty, disjoint sets V1,…, Vk, such that each Vp (p = 1,…, k) induces a clique (i.e., a complete subgraph), and A = ∪ \,p=1k \{\{i, j\}|i, j ∈ Vp, i ≠ j\}. The weight of such a clique partition A is defined as Σ\{i,j\}∈A wij. The problem is now to find a clique partition of maximum weight. The clique partitioning polytope P is the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all clique partitions of G. In this paper, we introduce several new classes of facet‐defining inequalities of P. These suffice to characterize all facet‐defining inequalities with right‐hand side 1 or 2. Also, we present a procedure, called patching, which is able to construct new facets by making use of already‐known facet‐defining inequalities. A variant of this procedure is shown to run in polynomial time. Finally, we give limited empirical evidence that the facet‐defining inequalities presented here can be of use in a cutting‐plane approach for the clique partitioning problem. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {We consider the class of 2-partition inequalities for the clique partitioning problem associated with complete graphs. We propose a heuristic separation algorithm for the inequalities and evaluate its usefulness in a cutting-plane algorithm. Our computational experiments fall into two parts. In the first part, we compare the LP objective values obtained by the proposed separator with those obtained by known separators for 2-partition inequalities and those obtained by exact polynomial-time separators for other classes of inequalities. These results demonstrate the importance of the 2-partition inequalities and the new separator. In the second part of the computational experiments, we apply the separator to different kinds of test instances from the literature. These results show that considerable improvements can be obtained in terms of narrowing the gaps between LP objective values and optimal partition values.}
