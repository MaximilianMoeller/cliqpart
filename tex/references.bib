  abstract = {Modularity is a recently introduced quality measure for graph clusterings. It has immediately received considerable attention in several disciplines, particularly in the complex systems literature, although its properties are not well understood. We study the problem of finding clusterings with maximum modularity, thus providing theoretical foundations for past and present work based on this measure. More precisely, we prove the conjectured hardness of maximizing modularity both in the general case and with the restriction to cuts and give an Integer Linear Programming formulation. This is complemented by first insights into the behavior and performance of the commonly applied greedy agglomerative approach.}

In this paper we study \{0, 1/2\}-CG cuts, arising for λ∈\{0, 1/2\}m. We show that the associated separation problem, \{0, 1/2\}-SEP, is equivalent to finding a minimum-weight member of a binary clutter. This implies that \{0, 1/2\}-SEP is NP-complete in the general case, but polynomially solvable whenA is related to the edge-path incidence matrix of a tree. We show that \{0, 1/2\}-SEP can be solved in polynomial time for a convenient relaxation of the systemAx{$<$}-b. This leads to an efficient separation algorithm for a subclass of \{0, 1/2\}-CG cuts, which often contains wide families of strong inequalities forP1. Applications to the clique partitioning, asymmetric traveling salesman, plant location, acyclic subgraph and linear ordering polytopes are briefly discussed.},

In this paper we study the clique partitioning polytope of the complete graphKn, i.e., is the convex hull of the incidence vectors of the clique partitionings ofKn. We show that triangles, 2-chorded odd cycles, 2-chorded even wheels and other subgraphs ofKn induce facets of.

The weight of such a clique partition A is defined as Σ\{i,j\}∈A wij. The problem is now to find a clique partition of maximum weight. The clique partitioning polytope P is the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all clique partitions of G. In this paper, we introduce several new classes of facet‐defining inequalities of P. These suffice to characterize all facet‐defining inequalities with right‐hand side 1 or 2. Also, we present a procedure, called patching, which is able to construct new facets by making use of already‐known facet‐defining inequalities. A variant of this procedure is shown to run in polynomial time. Finally, we give limited empirical evidence that the facet‐defining inequalities presented here can be of use in a cutting‐plane approach for the clique partitioning problem. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {We consider the class of 2-partition inequalities for the clique partitioning problem associated with complete graphs. We propose a heuristic separation algorithm for the inequalities and evaluate its usefulness in a cutting-plane algorithm. Our computational experiments fall into two parts. In the first part, we compare the LP objective values obtained by the proposed separator with those obtained by known separators for 2-partition inequalities and those obtained by exact polynomial-time separators for other classes of inequalities. These results demonstrate the importance of the 2-partition inequalities and the new separator. In the second part of the computational experiments, we apply the separator to different kinds of test instances from the literature. These results show that considerable improvements can be obtained in terms of narrowing the gaps between LP objective values and optimal partition values.}

  abstract = {Given two boolean matrices A arid B, we define the boolean product A A B as that matrix whose (i, j)th entry is vk(a\textasciitilde/, A bki). We define tile boolean sum A V B as that matrix whose (i, j)th entry is a ij V b\textasciitilde j. The use of boolean matrices to represent program topology (Presser [1], and Marimont [2], t'or example) has led to interest in algorithms for transforming the d × d boolean matrix M to the d × d boolean matrix M' given by: d M' = v M s where we defineM \textasciitilde{} = MandM \textasciitilde +I = M \textasciitilde AM. 4=1 ne convenience of describing the transformation as a boolean sum of boolean products has apparently l suggested the corresponding algorithms, the running times of which increase-other things being equal-as the cube of d. While refraining from comment on the area of utility of such matrices, we prove the validity of an algorithm whose running time goes up slightly faster than the square of d.

In his definition of Boolean sum and product, Presser uses "V" for product and "/k" for sum. This is apparently a typographicM error, for his subsequent usage is consistent with ours.
